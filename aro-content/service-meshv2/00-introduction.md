## What is Red Hat Service Mesh?
Applications are changing from monoliths into collections of small, independent, and loosely coupled services often referred to as cloud-native applications. These services are organized in a microservices architecture.

Managing the communication between different services, and analyzing and maintaining security, can be a challenge. This can be greatly simplified and optimized by using a service mesh to route requests from one service to another, and optimizing how the different services work with one another.

With Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh, you get a uniform way to connect, manage, and observe your microservices, without requiring you to redesign your application. As your containers and services evolve, Service Mesh allows you control ofâ€”the networked microservices through the use of a sidecar proxy that intercepts network communication between microservices. OpenShift Service Mesh provides integrated metrics, logging, and tracing, traditionally available only deep within the application or service.
