## Deploy Azure Service Operator
Azure Service Operator(ASO) is an open-source project by Microsoft Azure. ASO gives you the ability to provision and manages Azure resources within the Kubernetes plane by using familiar Kubernetes tooling and primitives. ASO consists of:
1. Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for each of the Azure services that a Kubernetes user can provision.
2. A Kubernetes controller that manages the Azure resources represented by the user-specified Custom Resources. The controller attempts to synchronize the desired state in the user-specified Custom Resource with the actual state of that resource in Azure, creating it if it doesn't exist, updating it if it has been changed, or deleting it.
